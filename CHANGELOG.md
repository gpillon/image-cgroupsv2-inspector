All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] — Unreleased

### Added
- **Quay registry scan mode**: scan container images directly from a
  Quay registry for cgroups v2 compatibility without requiring an
  OpenShift cluster connection
- New CLI options: `--registry-url`, `--registry-token`, `--registry-org`,
  `--registry-repo`, `--include-tags`, `--exclude-tags`, `--latest-only`
- Environment variable support for registry mode:
  `QUAY_REGISTRY_URL`, `QUAY_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, `QUAY_REGISTRY_ORG`
- Unified CSV schema with `source`, `registry_org`, `registry_repo` columns
- `AnalysisOrchestrator` for source-agnostic image analysis with
  incremental CSV saving
- Automatic `auth.json` generation from Quay token for podman pulls
- Tag filtering with glob patterns (include/exclude) and latest-only
- Quay test environment setup/teardown scripts
  (`manifests/quay/quay-setup.sh`, `manifests/quay/quay-teardown.sh`)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all new modules
- CLI integration tests for registry mode
- Node.js sibling-lookup fallback: when a `nodeXX_alpine` / `nodeXX_musl`
  binary fails to execute due to a libc / dynamic-linker mismatch (e.g.
  GitHub Actions Runner images shipping both glibc and musl builds
  side-by-side), the version is now inferred from the paired glibc
  sibling binary at the same installation path. This turns previously
  "Unknown" rows into deterministic "Yes" / "No" cgroup v2 compatibility
  verdicts. Cached state files are not invalidated: delete
  `.state_<target>.json` manually to re-scan affected images with the
  new logic.

### Changed
- Main script now supports dual-mode operation
  (OpenShift and registry are mutually exclusive)
- Image analysis extracted from `ImageCollector` into
  `AnalysisOrchestrator` (shared by both modes)
- CSV output now includes 3 additional columns (`source`,
  `registry_org`, `registry_repo`) — backward compatible
- Version bumped to 2.0.0
- GitHub Actions CI updated to run on feature branches
- OpenShift test manifests moved from `test/` to `manifests/cluster/`
- Docker/container support added (Containerfile by @beelzetron)

### Fixed
- Registry mode no longer uses stale `.pull-secret` from previous
  OpenShift scans (#34)
