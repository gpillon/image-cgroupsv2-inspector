# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Containerfile now runs `dnf update` during build so base-image packages are
  patched to the latest errata, clearing fixable OS-package CVEs.

### Changed
- Containerfile installs with `tsflags=nodocs` and clears the dnf cache in the
  same layer to keep the image smaller.

### Added
- README: document the prebuilt images published on Quay.io
  (`quay.io/asalvati/image-cgroupsv2-inspector`) with a `podman pull` example.
- CI: release workflow (`release.yml`) builds standalone binaries for
  Linux/macOS × amd64/arm64 using native runners (ARM runner for ARM
  builds), and pushes multi-arch container image to `ghcr.io`. ARM64
  builds are for ARM-native hosts only — the tool does not support
  cross-architecture scanning.
- CI: `binary-build-check` job in `ci.yml` verifies PyInstaller packaging
  on every push/PR.
- **JFrog Container Registry scan mode**: new `--jfrog-url`,
  `--jfrog-token`, `--jfrog-repo`, `--jfrog-image`, `--jfrog-username`
  CLI flags (with `JFROG_*` env-var fallbacks) activate scanning
  against a JFrog Artifactory Docker repository. Authenticates via
  Bearer access token; mutually exclusive with `--api-url` and
  `--registry-url`. Emits `source=jfrog` in the unified CSV.
- `src/jfrog_client.py` and `src/jfrog_collector.py`: speculate the
  Quay equivalents but use the CE-friendly `/api/repositories?type=local`
  + Docker Registry v2 catalog/tags endpoints, avoiding the Pro-gated
  per-repo configuration endpoint.
- `src/_registry_filters.py`: shared `filter_tags()` helper used by
  both Quay and JFrog collectors (extracted from `RegistryCollector`).
- `manifests/jfrog/jfrog-setup.sh` and `manifests/jfrog/jfrog-teardown.sh`:
  publish and remove the test-image catalog on a JFrog Container
  Registry instance using Bearer access-token authentication. Mirror
  the existing Quay scripts and reuse the same Containerfile contexts
  under `manifests/quay/deep-scan-images/`.
- `manifests/test-images.sh` shared library: extracts the canonical
  test-image catalog (`TEST_REPOS`, `UPSTREAM_TEST_IMAGES`,
  `push_test_images`) so Quay and JFrog setup/teardown scripts no
  longer duplicate the list.
- CI: bash syntax-check (`bash -n`) for all `manifests/**/*.sh` and
  `feature/jfrog-registry-scan` added to push/PR triggers.
- `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root: orientation file for Claude Code with
  dev environment, common commands, architecture overview, and
  project-specific invariants.
- `AGENTS.md` symlink to `CLAUDE.md` so vendor-neutral agents (Codex,
  Cursor, Aider, …) pick up the same orientation file.
- `quay-vs-jfrog.md`: deep-dive comparison of the Quay REST API vs
  the JFrog Artifactory + Docker Registry v2 API set as exercised by
  this project's clients. Covers endpoint mapping, pagination, filter
  semantics, cost/latency trade-offs, deletion asymmetries, and the
  CE-vs-Pro endpoint split.

### Changed
- CSV `source` column: Quay registry scans now emit `quay` (was
  `registry`); the new value `jfrog` is reserved for the upcoming
  JFrog scan mode. HTML report `source_mode` follows the same vocabulary.
  Breaking change for downstream consumers that filtered on
  `source == "registry"`.

### Fixed
- Go scanner and deep scan now detect bare commands (e.g. `exec grafana
  server`) in entrypoint scripts by searching standard PATH directories
  inside the extracted rootfs, including non-standard directories from
  the image's `PATH` environment variable. Also follows `set --`
  patterns (e.g. `set -- vault server; exec "$@"`) common in Docker
  entrypoint scripts. Previously only absolute paths were resolved.
- HTML report now shows the scanned binary path below each runtime
  compatibility cell (Java, Node.js, .NET, Go).
- CI `test` job now actually runs `pytest`. The job installed
  `pytest`/`pytest-cov` and uploaded `coverage.xml` but never invoked
  the test runner, so the suite had been silently skipped in CI. The
  new `Run tests` step executes `pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
  --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term` and produces the coverage report
  referenced by the existing upload step.
- OpenShift mode now configures bearer-token auth the way the Python
  Kubernetes client expects, so valid `--token` values are no longer
  dropped on protected API calls. `connect()` also performs an
  authenticated OpenShift API check instead of treating the unauthenticated
  `/version` probe as sufficient. The authenticated username is now
  printed during connection for operator feedback.
- Proxy env vars (`HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` and lowercase
  variants) are now honoured by the OpenShift API client (#67). The
  underlying `kubernetes` library uses `urllib3` directly and does not
  read these env vars automatically, which caused 504 Gateway Timeout
  in proxied containerised deployments. The API host is reached
  directly when its hostname matches `NO_PROXY` (exact or `.suffix`
  match) and via the proxy otherwise.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **HTML report** alongside the CSV output (#62): new `--html-report`
  flag generates a self-contained HTML report (DataTables + Jinja2,
  assets bundled for air-gapped environments) under
  `<output-dir>/html/<basename>.html`. New `--report-only <CSV>` flag
  regenerates the HTML offline from an existing CSV without re-scanning.
  Includes interactive pie chart, clickable status cards, per-runtime
  drill-down filters, and a removable filter banner. Adds
  `not_applicable` overall-status to replace the misleading `unknown`
  fallthrough for images with no detected runtime.
- **Deterministic Go binary cgroups v2 scanning** (#60): replaces the
  heuristic `strings`+`grep` approach with precise `go version` /
  `go version -m` analysis. Go ≥ 1.19 is natively compatible; older
  versions are checked against a v2-aware module matrix
  (`automaxprocs`, `automemlimit`, …). New `--disable-go` CLI flag and
  four new CSV columns (`go_binary`, `go_version`,
  `go_cgroup_v2_compatible`, `go_modules`); the deprecated
  `deep_scan_go_cgroup_libs` column is removed.
- **Node.js sibling-lookup fallback** for musl/Alpine binaries (#61):
  when a `nodeXX_alpine` / `nodeXX_musl` binary fails to execute due to
  a libc / dynamic-linker mismatch (e.g. GitHub Actions Runner images
  shipping both glibc and musl builds side-by-side), the version is now
  inferred from the paired glibc sibling at the same installation path,
  turning previously "Unknown" rows into deterministic Yes/No verdicts.
- Quay infrastructure for Go cgroups v2 compliance test images (#59):
  seven new deep-scan fixture images under
  `manifests/quay/deep-scan-images/go-v2-*/` covering compliant,
  needs-review, and unaware runtime/library combinations.
- `tests/test_version.py` smoke tests guarding against future drift
  between `src/__init__.py:__version__`, `pyproject.toml`, and the main
  script's import.

### Changed
- Align in-repo version to actual release tags and introduce a single
  source of truth (`src/__init__.py:__version__`); `pyproject.toml` and
  the main script now read from it. `--version` and the ASCII banner
  now report the real release version instead of the stale `2.0.0`
  literal that was never released.
- Backfill `CHANGELOG.md` entries for `[2.1.0]` through `[2.4.0]` from
  git history (these releases shipped without changelog updates).

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added

- Follow `exec` chains from entrypoint scripts to ELF binaries for deep-scan
- Pre-flight check for `strings` binary when `--deep-scan` is enabled (#54)

### Changed

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Deep-scan heuristic mode for cgroup v1 references in entrypoint scripts and binaries (#51)

### Changed
- Move `analysis_error` to last CSV column (#53)

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added
- `--resume` flag to allow restarting interrupted scans (#43, #45)
- `--image-timeout` flag for per-image pull+scan deadline (#42, #44)

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Handle unknown runtime versions: return "Unknown" compatibility instead of "No" (#40)
- Exclude `node_modules` from binary scan and add "Unknown" count to summary recap (#41)

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Quay registry scan mode**: scan container images directly from a
  Quay registry for cgroups v2 compatibility without requiring an
  OpenShift cluster connection
- New CLI options: `--registry-url`, `--registry-token`, `--registry-org`,
  `--registry-repo`, `--include-tags`, `--exclude-tags`, `--latest-only`
- Environment variable support for registry mode:
  `QUAY_REGISTRY_URL`, `QUAY_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, `QUAY_REGISTRY_ORG`
- Unified CSV schema with `source`, `registry_org`, `registry_repo` columns
- `AnalysisOrchestrator` for source-agnostic image analysis with
  incremental CSV saving
- Automatic `auth.json` generation from Quay token for podman pulls
- Tag filtering with glob patterns (include/exclude) and latest-only
- Quay test environment setup/teardown scripts
  (`manifests/quay/quay-setup.sh`, `manifests/quay/quay-teardown.sh`)
- Comprehensive unit tests for all new modules
- CLI integration tests for registry mode
- Node.js sibling-lookup fallback: when a `nodeXX_alpine` / `nodeXX_musl`
  binary fails to execute due to a libc / dynamic-linker mismatch (e.g.
  GitHub Actions Runner images shipping both glibc and musl builds
  side-by-side), the version is now inferred from the paired glibc
  sibling binary at the same installation path. This turns previously
  "Unknown" rows into deterministic "Yes" / "No" cgroup v2 compatibility
  verdicts. Cached state files are not invalidated: delete
  `.state_<target>.json` manually to re-scan affected images with the
  new logic.

### Changed
- Main script now supports dual-mode operation
  (OpenShift and registry are mutually exclusive)
- Image analysis extracted from `ImageCollector` into
  `AnalysisOrchestrator` (shared by both modes)
- CSV output now includes 3 additional columns (`source`,
  `registry_org`, `registry_repo`) — backward compatible
- GitHub Actions CI updated to run on feature branches
- OpenShift test manifests moved from `test/` to `manifests/cluster/`
- Docker/container support added (Containerfile by @beelzetron)

### Fixed
- Registry mode no longer uses stale `.pull-secret` from previous
  OpenShift scans (#34)
